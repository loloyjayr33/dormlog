DormLog is an online dormitory monitoring system designed to help dorm advisers track occupants’ sign-in and sign-out activities, daily tasks, and nighttime presence. It automatically notifies advisers at 9:00 PM of present and absent occupants, including reasons for absence, ensuring efficient, secure, and convenient dorm supervision.
