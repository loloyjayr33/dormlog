# dormlog
DormLog is an online dormitory monitoring system designed to help dorm advisers track occupants’ sign-in and sign-out activities, daily tasks, and nighttime presence. It automatically notifies advisers at 9:00 PM of present and absent occupants, including reasons for absence, ensuring efficient, secure, and convenient dorm supervision.

## Quick start (Vite + React)

This workspace now contains a minimal Vite + React (JavaScript) scaffold for the DormLog frontend.

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Files added:

- `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `index.html`
- `src/` React app with `App.jsx`, `main.jsx`, pages, and `styles.css`

To integrate with Supabase, implement API calls in the pages (Admin bulk creation, Occupant flows) and add environment variables.
